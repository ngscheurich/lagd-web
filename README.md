# LAGD Website Core + Web API

2018 was a great inaugural year for the [Louisiana Game Developers group
(LAGD)](https://www.lagd.network/). We’ve hosted multiple meetups as well as
[Post-Pixel](https://www.post-pixel.com/), an interactive art showcase. Most
importantly we’ve created an inclusive space dedicated to our mission: fostering
and promoting the game development community in Louisiana. As we move into the
new year, I hope to grow LAGD even more, and would like to expand the
capabilities of our current website to help support that effort. This is part of
that website, and includes a frontend for web browsers.

## Roadmap

Planned features for this project can be viewed on the [LAGD 2.0 Trello
Board](https://trello.com/b/FbUrOlR3/lagd-20). Cards for this project are
labeled `web`.

## Development

You’ll need at least the following to hack on this project:

- Node.js 10.8.0

Our recommended version manager is [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf); our
`.tool-versions` file is tracked in this repo, so you can just `asdf install` to
ensure you have the proper Node.js version.
